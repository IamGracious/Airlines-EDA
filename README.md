#Exploratory Data Analysis of Airlines dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data 
Airlines Flights Data Analysis
##Project Overview
This project explores the Airlines Flights Dataset to uncover patterns in flight delays, cancellations, and operational efficiency. Using Python for EDA and optional Power BI/Tableau dashboards, the analysis highlights actionable insights for business and operational decision-making.

##Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends.
Identify factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations.
Provide business-focused visualizations for non-technical stakeholders.
Compare the power of Python (EDA) vs. Power BI/Tableau (dashboards).

##Dataset
Source: Airlines Flights Data (Kaggle)
Size: ~5.8 million flight records
Time Span: Covers multiple years of domestic U.S. flights
Features: Airlines, origin & destination airports, delays, cancellations, distances, etc.

##Tools Used
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (EDA & plotting)
Power BI / Tableau: dashboarding for executives
Jupyter Notebook: workflow & documentation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – extracting insights from raw datasets
Data Cleaning & Wrangling – handling missing values, formatting data
Statistical Analysis – identifying trends and patterns
SQL basics 

##Key Insights
Flight Delays: Most delays are concentrated in specific airlines and hubs.
Seasonality: Weather and peak travel months show higher delay probability.
Airports: Certain airports consistently record higher delay and cancellation rates.
Business Relevance: Insights can help optimize scheduling, improve customer satisfaction, and support better operational planning.

##Recommendations
Extend analysis to include predictive modeling (delay forecasting).
Automate reporting dashboards for real-time airline operations.
